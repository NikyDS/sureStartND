I think the United States has a big problem with the incarceration population. People are given different sentences for the same crime. Parole is also given at different rates. I would like to create a recurrent neural network that would take information about different sentences, without accounting race, and give a similar sentence to the ones previously given in the last 5 years. I found this link, and while it does not contain the specific sentence and crime information, it does help show why this is such a big problem: https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/no-end-in-sight-americas-enduring-reliance-on-life-imprisonment/
